        <p><h1>Hello, world!</h1></p>

        <h2> First, we need to learn some basic HTML. </h2>
<h3>Headings define the outline of our webpage. There are six levels of headings.</h3>
<h2> Lists </h2>
<p> This is how we make an unordered list</p>

<ul> Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</ul>
<ul> add each item in it's own "li" element </ul>
<ul> they don't need to be in any particular order </ul>
        

       <h2> ordered/numbered Lists </h2>
       <li> Notice the "ul" element wrapping everything?</li>
       <li> But, the list item elements are the same</li>
       <li> Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
       <li> We should be noticing things is in precise order, because this is an ordered list.</li>
    
    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, we need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
   
    <p>Other times, we need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p> Thanks for reading! Learning HTML should be getting easier now.</p>
